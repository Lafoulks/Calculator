# Calculator
This is a basic calculator made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was made to finish the Foundations section of The Odin Project.
I faced many different struggles while completing this project, and in turn I became more familiar with the following:
  <br />-the importance of branching
  <br />-writing clear and concise pseudocode
  <br />-asking good questions
  <br />-scope
  <br />-implemneting multiple event listeners
  <br />-manipulating the DOM
